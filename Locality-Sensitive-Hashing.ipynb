I used a shingle size of 10, meaning that each shingle represents a sequence of 10 consecutive words from the text. I chose a shingle size of 10 so that I could capture longer sequences of words and phrases in the text. Larger shingle sizes help in identifying similarities that might span multiple sentences or concepts within a paragraph. I found that there were many paras with jaccard similarity equal to 1 when I kept the shingle size low. Hence I took a larger value."
